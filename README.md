# Personal Portfolio and Blog Platform
This project is a personal portfolio and blog platform showcasing my skills, projects, and technical blogs. The platform is built using Node.js with Express.js for the backend, Firebase for data storage, and Strapi for content management. The frontend is developed using Flutter, ensuring a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

### Portfolio Section:

### Blog Section:
Create, edit, and delete blog posts using Strapi as a CMS.

### Contact Form:

## Tools and Technology
### Flutter
Use to build frontend part of my application.

The concepts and Widgets I have used are:

- For async operation I have used: Futurebuilder and StreamBuilder
- For State Management: StatefulWidget and provider package
